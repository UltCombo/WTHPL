# Do What the Hell You Want to Public License v1.0.0

## Why?

[WTFPL v2](http://www.wtfpl.net/) is [confusing](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/149050/91517) — it preaches freedom, but claims a copyright on itself.

WTHPL is a fork of WTFPL v2, which removes all the nonsensical copyright babbling.

There is no license copyright, no software copyright, no copyright whatsoever! WTHPL is the **true** freedom license. Just Do What the Hell You Want to.

# Using the WTHPL in your projects

1. Copy the [`LICENSE` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UltCombo/WTHPL/master/LICENSE) to your project root.
1. ???
1. PROFIT!
